Learning Numpy : NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy stands for Numerical Python
To work with numpy we have to import numpy package.

array method :A Python Array is a collection of common type of data structures having elements with same data type.

zeros and one method- The numpy.zeros() function returns a new array of given shape and type, with zeros. the use of this method,when we do the vector operations.

Linspace method: The linspace() function returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval [start, stop]. The endpoint of the interval can optionally be excluded.

An identity matrix : is a square matrix in which the elements of the main diagonal are equal to one and the other elements equal to zero.
Return a 2-D array with ones on the diagonal and zero elsewhere.

Random = The random() method returns a random floating number between 0 and 1.The numpy.random.rand() function creates an array of specified shape and fills it with random values.uniform distribution.

The numpy. random. randn() function= it creates an array of specified shape and fills it with random values as per standard normal distribution.

numpy.random.randint()= is one of the function for doing random sampling in numpy. It returns an array of specified shape and fills it with random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive), i.e. in the interval [low, high).

Reshaping= What is reshaping in Python?
Reshaping means changing the shape of an array. The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension. By reshaping we can add or remove dimensions or change number of elements in each dimension.

min function=The min() function returns the item with the lowest value, or the item with the lowest value in an iterable.

Numpy argmin & argmax = is a function in python which returns the index of the minimum/maximum element from a given array along the given axis.

PANDAS LEARNING -it's apython library-it use to analyse data,Pandas Series = is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.).

What is a pandas label?Image result for label in pandas series Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.).

A Pandas DataFrame : is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional array, or a table with rows and columns.

to delete any column permanently will use'inplace=true' NOTE: axis'0'= row and axis'1'=columns.

access rows by loc and iloc function.
